    <h1>John Doe</h1>
    <h2>Stayin' Alive</h2>
    <p>Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk<br>
        I'm a woman's man, no time to talk<br>
        Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around<br>
        Since I was born<br>
        And now it's alright, it's okay<br>
        And you may look the other way<br>
        We can try to understand<br>
        The New York Times' effect on man<br>
        Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother<br>
        You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
        Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'<br>
        And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
        Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive<br>
        Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive<br>
        Oh, when you walk<br>
        Well now, I get low and I get high<br>
        And if I can't get either, I really try<br>
        Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes<br>
        I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose<br>
        You know it's alright, it's okay<br>
        I'll live to see another day<br>
